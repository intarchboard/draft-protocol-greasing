--- abstract

Long-term interoperability of protocols is an important goal of the network
standards process. Deployment success can depend on supporting change, which
can include modifying how the protocol is used, extending the protocol, or
replacing the protocol. This document presents concepts, considerations, and
techniques related to protocol maintenance, such as greasing or variability. The
intended audience is protocol designers and implementers.

# Introduction

Long-term interoperability of protocols is an important goal of the network
standards process {{?MAINTENANCE=RFC9413}}. Protocol deployment success
{{?SUCCESS=RFC5218}} can depend on supporting change, which
can include modifying how the protocol is used, extending the protocol, or
replacing the protocol.

Greasing, a technique initially designed for TLS {{?GREASE=RFC8701}} and later
adopted by other protocols such as QUIC {{?QUIC=RFC9000}}, can help support the
long-term viability of protocol extension points. Greasing is suitable for many
protocols but not all; {{Section 3.3 of ?VIABILITY=RFC9170}} discusses the
applicability and limitations of greasing. {{grease-considerations}} provides
additional protocol maintenance considerations.

Applications are built with the intent of serving user needs {{?END-USERS=RFC8890}}, which might only
require support for a subset of protocol features. Adapting to changing user
needs is a maintenance activity. For example, an HTTP deployment focused on
downloads might want to add support for uploads. Changing use of the application
and transport protocol features can affect the deployment's network traffic
profile. If expectations have been formed around historical patterns of use
i.e., ossification, introducing change might lead to deployment problems. {{variability}} presents
considerations about how intentionally increasing the variability of protocols
can mitigate some of these concerns.

Protocol extensions can provide longevity in the face of changing needs or
environment. However, a replacment protocol might be preferred when extensions
are not adequate or feasible. A protocol replacement could aggregate common
extensions and possibly make them mandatory, effectively defining a new baseline
that can simplify deployment and interoperability. A replacement protocol
version may or may not be compatible with other versions. A protocol may or may
not have a mechanism for version selection or agility. {{versions}} presents
considerations about designing for and/or implementing version negotiation and
migration.

# Considerations for Applying Greasing {#grease-considerations}

Greasing can take many forms, depending on the protocol and the nature of its
extension points.

Many protocols register values, codepoints, or numbers in a limited space. A
common approach that has developed in more recent protocols is to reserve a subset of the space for greasing (see
{{GREASE}}, {{Section 18.1 of QUIC}}, or {{Section 7.2.8 of RFC9114}}). Values
reserved for the purpose of greasing are herein referred to as grease values.
Implementations that receive grease values are required to ignore them. More
background to this approach is given in {{Section 3.3 of ?VIABILITY=RFC9170}}.
This section provides concrete suggestions for its usage.

It is assumed that endpoints should implement robust and broad extension
handling. A receiver or a parser implementation should not treat grease values
as individually special. Instead of identifying each grease value explicitly,
it is better to have a "catch all" mechanism that can handle receipt of unknown
extensions, whether grease values or not, gracefully or without error.

It is recommended that senders pick an unpredictable grease value to include in
relevant protocol elements. This ensures that receiver greasing requirements are
exercised. Using predictable grease values risks ossification. To increase the
variety of grease values, it is advised to reserve a large range. However, the
specific size and distribution of the grease range needs to accommodate the
protocol constraints. For instance, protocols that use 8-bit fields may find it
too costly to dedicate many grease values, while 32-bit or 64-bit fields are
likely to have no limitations.

It is recommended that senders use grease values at unpredictable times or
sequence points during protocol interactions. This avoids receivers
unintentionally ossifying on the occurrence of greasing in the temporal or
spatial domain.

It is recommended that large grease value sets are allocated in protocol
documents by defining a unique algorithm, to increase the chance that
receiver greasing requirements are exercised. However, the choice of algorithm
needs to consider the spread of values and the size of contiguous blocks between
grease values. It is common for protocol extension designers to want to reserve
a contiguous block of code points in order to aid iteration and experimentation.
Small contiguous blocks increase the chance that such reservations might
unintentionally use grease values, which could lead to interoperability
failures.

Protocols might ask IANA to create new registries for their extension points.
When greasing, it is recommended that only a single entry for the entire grease
value set is registered. When an algorithm has been used, it should be included
in the entry; see for example
https://www.iana.org/assignments/http3-parameters/http3-parameters.xhtml#http3-parameters-frame-types.

Grease values must not be used or registered for any other purpose. Registries
should include a label to identify the protected grease value range; a label of
"reserved" may be confused with other ranges that are reserved for private or
experimental extensions. An implementer that conflates these two meanings may
cause a new class of interoperability failure. Therefore a label such as
"reserved for greasing" may help to avoid the confusion.


# Considerations for Increasing Protocol Variability {#variability}

Greasing can maintain protocol extensibility by falsifying active use of its
extension points. However, greasing alone does not ensure positive use of extension mechanisms. A protocol may
define a wide-ranging extension capability that remains unused in the absence of
real use cases. This can lead to ossification that does not expect extensions,
leading to interoperability problems later on.

Long-term maintenance and interoperability can be ensured by exercising
extension points positively. To some extent this can be thought of as protocol
fuzzing. This might be difficult to exercise because varying the protocol
elements might change the outcome of interactions, leading to real errors.
However, some protocols allow elements to be be safely changed, as shown in the
following examples.

## Example: QUIC frames

QUIC packets contain frames. Receivers might build expectations on the
longitudinal aspects of packets or frames - size, ordering, frequency, etc. A
sender can quite often manipulate these parameters and stay compliant to the
requirements of the QUIC protocol.

A QUIC stream is an ordered reliable byte stream that is serialized as a
sequence of STREAM frames with a length and offset. Receivers are expected to
reassemble frames, which could arrive in any order, into an ordered reliable
byte stream that is readable by applications.

A form of positive testing is for a sender to unpredictably order the STREAM
frames that it transmits. For example, varying the sequence order of offset
values. This allows to exercise the QUIC reassembly features of the receiver
with the expectation that no failure would occur. However, doing this may
introduce delay or stream head-of-line blocking that affects the performance
aspects of a transmission, which may not be acceptable for a given use case. As
such, positive testing might be most appropriate to use in a subset of
connections, or phases within a connection.

# Considerations for Protocol Versions {#versions}

There are intrinsic and well-documented issues related to testing version
negotiation of protocols; see {{?EXTENSIBILITY=RFC6709}} and {{Sections 2.1 and
3.2 of VIABILITY}}. This section will be expanded with advice for protocol
designers and implementers about how to approach these problems.

# Security Considerations

The considerations in {{MAINTENANCE}}, {{GREASE}}, {{END-USERS}}, and
{{VIABILITY}} all apply to the topics discussed in this document.

The use of protocol features, extensions, and versions can already allow
fingerprinting. Any techniques that change parameters  in any way, including but
not limited to those discussed in this document, can affect fingerprinting. A
deeper analysis of this topic has been deemed out of scope.


# IANA Considerations
